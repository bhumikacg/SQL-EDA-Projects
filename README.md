# SQL Data analysis & EDA Projects
**Data Analysis on Maven Movies Dataset**:The Maven Movies dataset is a CSV file provided by Odin School. Basic SQL queries and joins were used to analyze the dataset, enabling efficient querying and data retrieval to gain valuable insights.


**Data Analysis on IG_CLONE Dataset**:  The IG_CLONE dataset, also provided by Odin School, is a CSV file. Sub-queries, common table expressions (CTEs), and joins were employed to query the data effectively. Additionally, grouping operations were used to aggregate data and derive meaningful insights.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Walmart Dataset**: The Walmart sales dataset is a CSV file obtained from Kaggle. I conducted data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the data for meaningful exploration and interpretation. The master table has been uploaded for reference.
