# SQL: Data analysis & EDA Projects
**Data Analysis on Maven Movies Dataset**:The Maven Movies dataset is a **CSV file** provided by Odin School. Basic **SQL queries and joins** were used to analyze the dataset, enabling efficient **querying, analysis, and data retrieval** to gain valuable insights.


**Data Analysis on IG_CLONE Dataset**:  The IG_CLONE dataset, also provided by Odin School, is a **CSV file**. **Sub-queries, common table expressions (CTEs), and joins** were employed to query the data effectively. Additionally, grouping operations were used to aggregate data and derive meaningful insights.


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Walmart Dataset**: The Walmart sales dataset is a **CSV file** obtained from **Kaggle**. I performed **data cleaning and feature engineering** to prepare the data for meaningful exploration and interpretation. The master table has been uploaded for reference.
